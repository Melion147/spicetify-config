## **How to use** (ARCH perspective)

After the basic setup of Spicetify, Replace the ./Themes folder with the one from this Github Repo. If using other Themes, extract the Comfy Folder from ./Themes and move it into your own Themes folder.
Replace config-xpui.ini with the one from this repo or add the Patch lines.
Finally apply with : `spicetify apply`
